        <h1>Introduction To Machine Learning:</h1>
        <p>In order to understand Machine Learning the basic idea it is best for us to go through the building of project. We will develop an
        understanding of theory as we go along and also how to implement a basic Machine Learning Algorithm application. We first must have a problem 
        or task for the algorithm to solve for us. We will building an algorithm that can predict the price of a house when given certain features of 
          the house.</p>
