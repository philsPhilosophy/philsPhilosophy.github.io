    <h1>A Shallow Analysis: A Good Man is Hard to Find</h1>

    <p>Ultimately, the <i>good man</i> is the Misfit. O’Connor places us with the omniscience to see the thoughts of the grandmother in her final moments (we can play judge, but we must imagine someone viewing all our thoughts.) It is clear that the grandmother <i>plays moral</i> in order to achieve her own goals. It is this sin that perhaps evokes God’s wrath upon her, and her kin. Here lies the Misfits’ purpose, to enact God’s wrath on Earth, for balance.</p>

    <p>The Misfit is a good man because he; confronts his suffering, confronts the absurdity of being human, and acts in accordance with God’s will. If we take what he says as true, and we have no reason to believe he has any reason to lie, then he was wrongly imprisoned for killing his father, seeing for himself the absurdity of human judgment. He has seen <i>and been</i> a lot; in a tornado, a witness to horrors, etc. This gives him a sense of omniscience, even perhaps closer to God? He talks of judgment, saying he cannot remember what he done and his punishment has misfit his crime. His self-given name proclaims: <i>human judgment is misfit.</i></p>

    <p>The grandmother is the embodiment of human judgment. She passes judgment in some form or another to almost all the characters but in particular to the character opposite of The Misfit, Red Sam.</p>

    <p>Red Sam is proclaimed a good man by the grandmother. Red Sam is “struck” by such a statement, why? Yet, as a “good man”, Red Sam has his wife doing everything, interrupts her talking for her to get back to tending to the customers, and is overweight. All this seems at least somewhat in contrast to the Christ figure. The Misfit not only compares himself to Christ but is described as; shirtless, thin shoulder blades, black hat, and thin red ankles which could be put in comparison to; shirtless on a cross, skinny, crown of thorns, and stakes through the feet, respectively. The Misfit states it was Christ that “showed everything off balance.” That Christ, like himself, shows human judgment is misfit.</p>

    <p>But here is O’Connor’s force. The Misfit is sent from God, like Jesus before him, but only is forced to live as a misanthrope, an outlaw, a degenerate, in order to enact God’s wrath, God’s judgment and balance. And if we the readers are to find any peace in such a horror story we must be willing to question our own human judgment of even the most seemingly vile. Think deeper about what use claiming moral judgment serves.</p>
